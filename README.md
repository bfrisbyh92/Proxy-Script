# Fresh Proxy Script
## By Brendan Frisby
----------------------------------

#### This is a script I made to keep fresh proxies setup to be used with Proxychains-ng. I run it as a cron job on my mac, so that I can use those config files with proxychains -f flag, and I specify the files that this script outputs.


<ul>
<li>
Configured to use random_chain setting intentionally 
</li>
<li>
Slightly higher TCP timeout and connect settings. About 20% higher than default 
</li>
<li>
These are amazing for scanning. We have 2-3 thousand fresh proxies added with this script
</li>
<li>
If you only want fresh formatted proxies, you can run the formatted-lists.py, or comment out where it cleans up those files in the proxies.py script
</li>
</ul>
